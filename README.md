# capstone-ai-ml


Welcome to my Repository.

As part of the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence course at Imperial College, the repository contains the final Capstone Project to demonstrate some of our learnings during the course.

My selected task for this project is prediciting churn score for a website.

Why Have I chosen this task?

My career is based on implementing Salesforce, a customer relationship system. Customer acquisition and churn are common and costly parts of the customer lifecylce. Being able to predict customers that are likely to churn can, in theory, help businesses prevent or mitigate the risks.


The Dataset for this project is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/churn-risk-rate-hackerearth-ml/?select=sample_submission.csv. If you are interested in similar projects, visit kaggle or https://www.interviewquery.com/p/data-science-projects-for-students

Predicting the churn score for a website based on the features provided in the database.
 
Churn rate is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers who leave a business over a specific time period. . Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value is based on:
- User demographic information
- Browsing behavior
- Historical purchase data among other information
